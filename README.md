# Obstacles
<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>I have created this project in Unity years ago with the purpose of learning C# and game developing in Unity. This is a 2D mobile game, in which the player has to avoid the incoming obstacles by navigating the main character with their finger. This project features object and script mechanics in Unity on intermidiate level.</p>
